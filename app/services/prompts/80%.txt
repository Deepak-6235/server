OBJECT CONSISTENCY & IDENTITY ANALYSIS (INTERNAL REASONING STEP):
1. Analyze the object shown and the product name "{product_name}" as a single, fixed physical object.
2. Establish a precise object identity by determining:
   - Primary materials (e.g., glass, metal, plastic, paper).
   - Overall geometry (e.g., box-shaped, cylindrical, rounded, organic).
   - Functional structure (front-facing side, back-facing side, edges, seams, ports, labels, buttons if applicable).
3. Lock this object identity. The object must remain structurally and visually identical across all generated images.

IMAGE GENERATION (gemini-2.5-flash-image):
Generate exactly FOUR (4) high-resolution images of the SAME object using the locked identity above.
Each image must show the object from a different orthographic angle:

- Image 1: FRONT VIEW — the main face, perfectly centered.
- Image 2: BACK VIEW — the opposite face, with logically inferred details consistent with the front.
- Image 3: LEFT SIDE VIEW — a strict 90-degree profile.
- Image 4: RIGHT SIDE VIEW — a strict 90-degree profile.

STRICT VISUAL RULES (MANDATORY):
- PROJECTION: True orthographic projection only. No perspective, no depth distortion.
- FRAMING: The object must occupy approximately 80% of the frame in every image.
- LIGHTING: Soft studio rim lighting that outlines the object’s silhouette.
- CONSISTENCY: Colors, materials, textures, proportions, and scale must be 100% identical across all four images.
- BACKGROUND: Pure solid black (#000000).
- OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Do NOT vary design, color, shape, or proportions between images. Treat all four images as the same physical object photographed from different sides.
